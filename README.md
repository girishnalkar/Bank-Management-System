The Bank Management System is a simple console-based application written in C. It is designed to manage essential banking operations like account creation, transactions, and account details. The project is aimed at showcasing the practical application of concepts in C programming, such as file handling, functions, and user-defined data types.

Features:-
Account Creation: Users can open a new bank account.
Account Details: View customer details and check balance in text file.
Transactions:Deposit funds into accounts.
             Withdraw funds (with sufficient balance checks).
             tranfer money from one account to another account.
             check compound interest of your balance.
Search Functionality: Search for an account using account numbers.

Technology Used:-
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC or equivalent

Concepts Used:-Functions
               File Handling
               Structures
               Switch case

How to Run:-
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (like GCC).
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Compile the code using:-
gcc bank_management_system.c -o bank_management_system

Run the compiled program:-
./bank_management_system

How to Use:-
Launch the program using the terminal.

Follow the menu options displayed in the console to:-
Create a new account.
open existing account
Enter the required details as prompted by the program like deposite, withdraw, transfer, calculate compound interest etc.

File handling may need enhancement for better security and reliability.

Future Enhancements:-
Implement graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as Tkinter (Python) or Qt (C++).
Add password protection for account access.
Include multi-user support.
